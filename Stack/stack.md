# What is a Stack?

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Key Operations in a Stack:
- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove the top element of the stack.
- **Peek/Top**: Retrieve the top element without removing it.
- **IsEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.
- **Size**: Get the total number of elements in the stack.

## Characteristics of a Stack:
- **Restricted Access**: Elements can only be added or removed from the top.
- **Dynamic Size**: Stacks grow or shrink dynamically, depending on the operations.

## Applications of Stacks:
1. **Browser History**: Tracks visited pages (back and forward functionality).
2. **Undo Mechanism**: Used in text editors to implement undo/redo actions.
3. **Expression Evaluation**: Convert infix to postfix or evaluate postfix expressions.
4. **Recursion**: Function call stack in programming is a classic stack implementation.
5. **Parentheses Matching**: Validate balanced parentheses in strings.
