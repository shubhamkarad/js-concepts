Practical Applications: 

1. Binary Systems:

Used to store data and execute instructions in computing systems.
Example: File storage, data representation in databases.

2.Bit Manipulation:

Essential in low-level programming for performance optimization.
Example: Flipping bits for encryption or error detection.

3.Logical Gates:

Used in hardware design, such as CPUs and memory units.
Example: ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units) rely on gates for calculations.
