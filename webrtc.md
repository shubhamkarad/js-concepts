WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)

WebRTC is a technology that enables real-time communication (audio, video, and data) directly between web browsers or devices without the need for a server. It relies on UDP for fast and low-latency data transfer.

Why WebRTC Uses UDP

Speed: Real-time communication requires minimal delay.

Flexibility: UDP's lightweight nature is ideal for dynamic data like audio and video.

Packet Loss Tolerance: Minor data loss in voice or video calls is acceptable.

How WebRTC Works

Signaling:

Two devices exchange information (e.g., IP addresses) via a signaling server.

Peer-to-Peer Connection:

Once connected, data flows directly between devices using UDP.

Real-Time Data Transfer:

Audio, video, and data streams are sent with minimal delay.

Example of WebRTC

Imagine a video call between Alice and Bob:

Alice and Bobâ€™s devices exchange their IPs via a server (signaling).

Once connected, audio and video streams are sent directly between their devices using WebRTC.

UDP ensures the call is smooth, even if some data packets are lost.

Key Features of WebRTC

Peer-to-Peer:

Devices communicate directly without intermediaries.

Low Latency:

UDP ensures real-time speed.

Cross-Platform:

Works in web browsers, mobile apps, etc.

Secure:

Uses encryption to protect data.

WebRTC Components

MediaStream:

Handles audio and video streams.

RTCDataChannel:

Transfers custom data (e.g., files or messages).

ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment):

Finds the best path for devices to connect.

Applications of WebRTC

Video Conferencing: Zoom, Google Meet, and MS Teams.

Online Gaming: Peer-to-peer gaming communication.

File Sharing: Real-time sharing of files without servers.

IoT Devices: Communication between smart devices.
