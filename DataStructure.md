## Big O Notation

    - We use Big O to describe the performance of an algorithm.  O(n) - linear : Where n represents the size of the items.

- examples:
  - console.log(numbersp[0]) | O(1) - Constant
  - If there are 2 for loops then | O(2n)
  - 2 nested loops | O(n^2) - Increase in Quadratic way
  - Lograthmic O(log n) :

## Data Structure

    1. Arrays.
    2. LinkList

### Design patterns

    - 3 types of patterns
        1. Singleton
        2. Builder
        3. Factory

#### Singleton

    - Use this when you absolutely need a single instance that is accessible globally.

#### Builder

    - Constructor result in the beautiful builder pattern, we can use this in making complex apis.

#### Factory

    - Create a different types of users.

#### Facade (Structural)

        - Hide everything

    _ Creational patterns are for object creation.
    _ Structural patterns are how objects relate to each other
    _ Facade pattern - Good programming [Encapsulation]
    _ Adapter pattern.
    _ Strategy pattern - Have a common goal
    _ Observer pattern  - Subscriber and observer
