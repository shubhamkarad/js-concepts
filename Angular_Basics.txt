Angular Basics

main.ts - Entry point to Angular

## Properties & interpolations

## ngOnInit - Where the component loads

### **Lifecycle Execution Order**

Hereâ€™s the typical sequence in order:

1. **ngOnChanges** (if `@Input` properties change).
2. **ngOnInit** (initialization of the component).
3. **ngDoCheck** (custom change detection logic).
4. **ngAfterContentInit** (after `<ng-content>` is initialized).
5. **ngAfterContentChecked** (after projected content is checked).
6. **ngAfterViewInit** (after the component's view is initialized).
7. **ngAfterViewChecked** (after the component's view is checked).
8. **ngOnDestroy** (just before the component is destroyed).

### **Best Practices for Lifecycle Hooks**

1. **Use `ngOnInit`** for initialization logic like API calls or setting up properties.
2. **Avoid heavy logic in `ngDoCheck`** as it runs frequently.
3. **Clean up resources** like subscriptions or intervals in `ngOnDestroy`.
4. **Use `ngAfterViewInit`** for DOM-dependent libraries but avoid modifying DOM elements directly.

Hi Sir, Good morning. Sorry I was not able to join the Standup as I was stuck in the traffic when coming to office
